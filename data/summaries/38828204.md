**Main Objectives**: The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of engineered exosomes loaded with microRNA-29b-2 (miR29b-2) for targeted delivery to the brain, specifically to reduce presenilin 1 (PSEN1) expression and β-amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Researchers sought to explore the therapeutic potential of these engineered exosomes as a novel treatment strategy for AD, focusing on their ability to enhance oligonucleotide drug delivery while minimizing immune responses.

**Methods**: The study utilized genetic engineering techniques to create exosomes expressing targeting ligands (cholecystokinin or somatostatin) and immune evasion proteins (CD47) for improved delivery efficiency to the hippocampus. Experimental methods included the transfection of dendritic cells with lentiviral vectors, exosome characterization using nanoparticle tracking analysis, and various in vitro and in vivo models to assess the therapeutic effects of engineered exosomes on disease-associated protein levels. Techniques such as Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence imaging were employed to evaluate protein expression and exosome uptake.

**Key Findings**: Results demonstrated that engineered exosomes significantly improved delivery to the brain and effectively reduced PSEN1 levels, resulting in decreased β-amyloid oligomers in both cellular and mouse models of AD. Notably, the study found that miRNA-29b-2-5p inhibited γ-secretase activity and amyloid production, highlighting its therapeutic viability. Furthermore, the presence of specific receptors enhanced exosome uptake in targeted cells, underscoring the potential of engineered exosomes as effective therapeutic agents in AD management. Overall, this research supports the development of exosome-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
