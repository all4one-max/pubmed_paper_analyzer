**Main Objectives**: The study aims to investigate the roles of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), focusing on their impact on prognosis, treatment resistance, and therapeutic efficacy. It seeks to explore mechanisms of drug resistance, the potential of targeting macrophages, and the development of innovative CAR macrophage (CAR-M) therapies to enhance treatment outcomes.

**Methods**: Researchers employed various methodologies, including literature reviews, analyses of macrophage populations in MCL tissues, evaluation of therapeutic interventions (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy, obinutuzumab, venetoclax), and preclinical studies on CAR-M utilizing nanocomplexes for genetic programming. They also analyzed genetic mutations and their relationship with treatment responses, particularly focusing on macrophage polarization and immune profiling.

**Key Findings**: Findings indicate that M2-like macrophages are associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance in MCL. Strategies to reduce M2 macrophages or enhance M1-like differentiation show promise in improving therapeutic responses. The study highlights the potential of CAR-M therapies to overcome limitations of traditional CAR T-cell approaches, enhance tumor infiltration, and stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. Additionally, the interplay between the TME and MCL cells underscores the importance of targeting the TME in treatment strategies, with specific genetic mutations influencing patient outcomes. Overall, the research advocates for innovative therapeutic approaches that leverage the dynamics of macrophages in the TME to improve outcomes for MCL patients.
