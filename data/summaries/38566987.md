1. **Main Objectives**:  
The study investigates the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), focusing on their influence on prognosis, treatment response, and potential therapeutic strategies. Key research questions include the impact of macrophage polarization, particularly M2-like macrophages, on patient outcomes and resistance to therapies, as well as the exploration of innovative treatments like CAR-macrophages (CAR-M).

2. **Methods**:  
The researchers employed a combination of literature reviews, clinical trial analyses, immunological assays, co-culture experiments, and transcriptomic analyses. They investigated macrophage levels, particularly CD163+ M2-like macrophages, and their effects on tumor proliferation and immune responses. Additionally, preclinical models were used to evaluate the efficacy of CAR-M approaches and other combinatorial therapies, which included targeting specific signaling pathways and utilizing nanotechnology for macrophage programming.

3. **Key Findings**:  
The study revealed that high levels of M2-like macrophages are associated with poor prognosis and reduced therapeutic efficacy in MCL. Immunomodulatory treatments, such as lenalidomide, were shown to decrease M2-like macrophages and enhance phagocytic activity. Novel therapies targeting macrophage signaling pathways and CAR-M demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity, suggesting a promising direction for overcoming resistance and enhancing treatment efficacy in MCL. The findings emphasize the necessity of integrating TME factors into treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes in lymphoma therapies.
